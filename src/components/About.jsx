                Iâ€™m currently a fourth-year student at Carleton University
                studying Computer Science. My love for math and problem-solving
                has always driven me, providing a foundation for logical
                thinking and analytical skills. At the same time, I have a deep
                appreciation for creativity and its role in technology. This
                dual passion led me to the world of programming, where I started
                my journey with Python. From automating tasks and web scraping
                to building GUI applications, Python became my playground for
                blending logic and creativity. In addition to Python, I have
                ventured into web development, creating small websites using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects have allowed me to
                combine my problem-solving skills with my creative flair,
                crafting interactive and visually appealing web experiences.
