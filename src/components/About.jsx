                I'm currently a fourth-year student at Carleton University
                studying Computer Science. My love for math and problem-solving
                has always driven me, but there's another realm that equally
                captures my interest â€” the digital world. I've been immersing
                myself in coding ever since high school, starting with Python
                (Automation, Web Scraping, GUI, Pen Testing), and then delving
                into web development, mastering technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. Nowadays, I spend most of my coding time
                crafting full-stack applications, blending my passion for
                logical challenges with creative solutions in the web space.
